First, determine the number of years you've had the peach tree. The user mentioned that it's been around for 10 years.

Next, find out the average yield per year, which is 299 peaches per year.

Then, calculate the total number of peaches by multiplying the number of years by the average yield: 10 years * 299 peaches/year = 2990 peaches.

Finally, conclude that you have accumulated a total of 2990 peaches from your peach tree over the past decade.

To determine the total number of peaches harvested from your peach tree over its 10-year life, follow these steps:

1. **Number of Years:** 
   - The peach tree has been around for **10 years**.

2. **Average Peaches Per Year:**
   - Each year, it yields approximately **299 peaches** on average.

3. **Total Peaches Harvested:**
   \[
   \text{Total Peaches} = \text{Number of Years} \times \text{Peaches per Year}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total Peaches} = 10 \times 299 = 2990
   \]

\[
\boxed{2990\ \text{peaches}}
\]
